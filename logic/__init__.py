# logic/__init__.py
# This file can be empty.
# It is used to tell Python that this directory should be treated as a package.
# This allows us to import modules from this directory in other files.
# Why empty? The logic package contains only one module (profile_generator.py).
# We import the ProfileGenerator class directly where needed (e.g., from logic.profile_generator import ProfileGenerator).
# There's no need for package-level setup in this case.
